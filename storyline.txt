MAKE IT RAIN

Dr. Steve Martin is a talented nephologist/aeromechanical engineer who has just discovered how to create forcefield that causes clouds to generate greatly increased rainfall in addition to becoming sentient and gaining emotions.  Seeking to capitalize on his new invention, Steve Martin travels to Somalia with the aim of being adobted as their fearless leader due to the increased rainfall.  Upon arriving there, Steve Martin tests his forcefield, expending large amounts of money in the process to power the forcefield generator.  Unfortunately, the clouds, now sentient, don't feel like raining, and would rather just float around blissfully.  Steve Martin's solution is to ascend into the clouds in a hot air balloon and TEACH THEM A D*** LESSON.  But it won't be that easy
The militaristic environmentalist group ENVIRO-SAVE, upon hearing of Steve Martin's bizarre experiments, has brainwashed the local avians with the help of their own mad scientists to take down Steve Martin's weather balloon.  They greatly disapprove of him fiddling with the environment.  Also, the clouds will not go gently into that good night, and will strike back at Steve Martin.  
Time is wasting!  you must endear the people of Somalia to you before you run out of money to power your forcefield!  Drill into those clouds and MAKE IT RAIN!
